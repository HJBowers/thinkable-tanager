Personal-Project #145; Flappy bird using Phaser and Javascript

Create and deploy a personal project of a [simplified version of Flappy Bird](http://www.lessmilk.com/game/flappy-bird/) in only 65 lines of Javascript with the Phaser framework.


## Specs:
- [ ] Main menu at start of game includes settings to select game mode
- [ ] Player can move "flappy bird" up and down to avoid obstacles, not left and right
- [ ] Map is generated randomly, with various obstacles along the way
- [ ] Player can reset/restart game at any time
- [ ] Player can pause game
- [ ] Creating a readable UI that is mobile friendly size
- [ ] Fine tune existing animations
- [ ] Minimum of 3 additional game modes
- [ ] Add Sweet theme song


## Stretch Goals:
- [ ] Add "exploration mode" where players can choose different paths by going up or down
- [ ] "Chimera mode" where various power ups change both your bird's appearance and how it interacts with obstacles
- [ ] Particles (math equation that dynamically generates sprites)
- [ ] Player can save game
- [ ] Database saves a record of path so future players can try to find paths other players have taken for a bonus.
- [ ] Player log in and database to save high scores, achievements, flap count
- [ ] Network 2-player "vs mode" over using 2 separate computers
- [ ] User can adjust game speed (aka difficulty level)
- [ ] Add shooter mode with enemy birds, weapons, and powerups
- [ ] Add "upgrades" for Flappy Bird to enhance speed of bird and slow down screen scroll
- [ ] At end of "Chimera Mode" the game gives the option to save an image of your final bird with all powerups


## Quality Rubric

  **Well formatted code**
  - [ ] Code uses a linter, which can be invoked with a command (e.g. `npm run lint`).
  - [ ] Running the linter on all source code files generates no linting errors.

  **Clear and readable code**
  - [ ] Variables, functions, css classes, etc. are meaningfully named (no comments exist in code to explain functionality - the names serve that function)

  **Clear and useful README**
  - [ ] Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions.

  **Proper dependency management**
  - [ ] There is a command to install dependencies (e.g. `npm install`) and it is specified in the installation and setup instructions of the README.

  **Good project management**
  - [ ] Commit messages are concise and descriptive.
  - [ ] Each commit has a specific scope, and does not include unrelated code.
  - [ ] All features are added via pull requests.
  - [ ] Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made.
  - [ ] Every pull request has been reviewed with [Prrr](http://prrr.apps.learnersguild.org/).
  - [ ] Submit a Prrr at the end of day Tuesday-Friday
