Personal-Project #145; Flappy bird using Phaser and Javascript

Create and deploy a personal project of a [simplified version of Flappy Bird](http://www.lessmilk.com/game/flappy-bird/) in only 65 lines of Javascript with the Phaser framework. 


## Specifications

- [ ] User can play a basic Flappy Bird clone using the Spacebar
- [ ] Map is generated randomly with a reusable seed, allowing multiple players to see the same random map.
- [ ] User can log in, and we will use a postresql database to save high scores, achievements, flap count
- [ ] Users will be able to connect to each other from different computers to play a head-to-head game.
- [ ] Game saves win loss record after versus games
- [ ] Database saves locations where players have died, and you can see the deaths of people you played a vs. match against.
- [ ] Test backend and testable front end functions with chai

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Implement character movement without Phaser
- [ ] Implement random obstacle generation without Phaser
- [ ] Implement collision detection without Phaser



## Quality Rubric

  **Well formatted code**
  - [ ] Code uses a linter, which can be invoked with a command (e.g. `npm run lint`).
  - [ ] Running the linter on all source code files generates no linting errors.

  **Clear and readable code**
  - [ ] Variables, functions, css classes, etc. are meaningfully named (no comments exist in code to explain functionality - the names serve that function)

  **Clear and useful README**
  - [ ] Repository includes a README file with installation and setup instructions.

  **Proper dependency management**
  - [ ] There is a command to install dependencies (e.g. `npm install`) and it is specified in the installation and setup instructions of the README.

  **Good project management**
  - [ ] Commit messages are concise and descriptive.
  - [ ] Each commit has a specific scope, and does not include unrelated code.
  - [ ] All features are added via pull requests.
  - [ ] Every pull request has a description summarizing the changes made.
  - [ ] Every pull request has been reviewed with [Prrr](http://prrr.apps.learnersguild.org/).
  - [ ] Submit a Prrr at the end of day Tuesday-Friday
  
  **Testing management**
  - [ ] Test backend and testable front end functions with chai
